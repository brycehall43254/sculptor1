# Sculptor: run parallel Claude Code agents in safe, local sandboxes

Sculptor lets you run simultaneous Claude Code agents in safe, isolated sandboxes. Sculptor runs locally, letting you iterate quickly in your chosen IDE without going through PRs. We‚Äôre currently alpha testing Sculptor and are excited to hear what you think!

### Kick off agents in parallel

Sculptor is a web UI for creating and managing multiple agents. Each agent runs in its own isolated sandbox with a clone of your repo, so you can experiment and make changes safely. Desktop app coming soon!

### Test & edit agent changes locally

Sync to any agent‚Äôs sandbox to instantly see its file changes in your local IDE. This lets you review, run, test, and edit the agent‚Äôs changes in your local environment while it's working in a sandbox, giving you the best of both worlds.

### Easily merge changes & resolve conflicts

Quickly merge the agent branches that you like. Sculptor agents can help you resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

# Basic workflows

## Creating agents

1. On your projects homepage, describe your task to the agent.
2. Press ‚ÄúStart task‚Äù or cmd+Enter to start the task. Press Enter to start a new line in your task description.
3. Your new agent will appear in the sidebar. Click into it to see the changes as the agent works.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1840" height="1191" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 5 25 12 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c94daef-c100-4d4f-9e2b-27a0bff37352" />
</p>

When you‚Äôre viewing an agent‚Äôs task, you can press the + New Agent button or cmd+N to quickly create a new agent.

<p align="center">
  <img width="2000" height="765" alt="sculptor_new-agent" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/533f6399-a3ef-49d6-96af-5063d1219705" />
</p>

## Live Sync: Reviewing the agent‚Äôs changes

1. Click the Live Sync button in the sidebar or top right corner. The agent‚Äôs changes will sync to your local branch, where you can view it instantly in your IDE.
2. Run the agent‚Äôs code, run terminal commands, make edits in your IDE, or keep working with the agent in chat while in Live Sync mode. Any local changes you make will sync back to the agent‚Äôs branch and persist after turning off Live Sync.

<p align="center">
  <img width="2000" height="632" alt="live sync" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2989e130-9995-48b6-9e50-7657c33bb0b4" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img width="2000" height="698" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 5 36 25 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bd92f8e-985e-4ac1-afb3-97d643926565" />
</p>

Note: Live Sync will be disabled if you have uncommitted changes in your current local branch. Stash or commit changes to enable Live Sync.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1601" height="506" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 5 33 27 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d8c3ac8-ebb6-412e-b5ef-134b733403b0" />
</p>

## Merging the agent‚Äôs changes

1. Turn off Live Sync to switch your local state back to where it was.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e4799fc-a3dc-4783-bc9f-9874661b19de" alt="Image 1" width="45%" style="vertical-align: top;" />
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea86c597-15d4-4965-b82c-73b89eee4869" alt="Image 2" width="45%" style="vertical-align: top;"/>
</p>

2. Commit the agent‚Äôs changes in Sculptor.

<p align="center">
  <img width="45%" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 5 37 45 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c129b2cf-ea60-490f-8379-9fe24c281dd0" />
</p>

3. Press the Merge button in the top right corner, select your target branch, and pull the agent‚Äôs changes.

<p align="center">
  <img width="45%" alt="pull agent changes" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c30fdb1-fc29-48dd-9b45-1498f90ed386" />
</p>

## Resolving merge conflicts

If merge conflicts arise when you merge the agent branch into your target branch, you will see this dialogue. Choose whether to force merge or abort if there are conflicts that can‚Äôt be resolved.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1840" height="1191" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-17 at 5 47 04 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aca9db5b-782b-437b-ae5c-75d9f4268789" />
</p>

Alternatively, you can push your target branch to the agent‚Äôs branch first. You can then tell the agent to resolve any merge conflicts that arise. After it‚Äôs done, merge the agent branch into your target branch as described in the last section (Merging the agent‚Äôs changes).

<p align="center">
  <img width="45%" alt="push agent changes" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b8cf01a-bfd0-48ff-b756-8e5cb457ea9d" />

# Advanced workflows

## Compaction

If your task conversation gets too long, click into the context meter and choose "compact".

<p align="center">
  <img width="1312" height="912" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-16 at 9 05 58‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cef578cd-c6d0-4bf5-8e81-26713f889a05" />
</p>


## @autocomplete file and folder names

Anytime during a task, @mention a part of a filename to autocomplete it.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1312" height="912" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-16 at 9 07 40‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/778b8821-624a-4f1d-96aa-c056840bcb1b" />
</p>

## Custom dockerfile

Have project-specific dependencies you want in your agent environment? We support specifying a Dockerfile or image as per the devcontainer spec.

```json
{
  "name": "dev",
  "image": "node:latest"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "name": "dev",
  "build": {
    "dockerfile": "Dockerfile"
  },
}
```

```Dockerfile
FROM node:latest

# if you need environment variables -- inject them here
ENV NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'

RUN node --version

```

## Task error recovery

Hit an unexpected error with Sculptor? Contact us on discord to report the issue and see if others have hit it -- but in the meanwhile, try asking Sculptor to restart the task from the latest snapshot.

<p align="center">
  <img width="993" height="802" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-16 at 9 12 16‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68fe0e15-e364-4f87-9572-5ce9731eea76" />
</p>

## Autoupdate

Get notified when a new sculptor version is available:

<p align="center">
  <img width="1205" height="803" alt="Updating in progress" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6405147-af55-43a1-94ee-f8d9fb103cab" />
</p>

Note that you currently have to restart sculptor to get the new version. We recommend you wait until tasks are completed - Sculptor is still in active development!

<p align="center">
  <img width="1202" height="802" alt="Update complete" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2b1498c-6edd-4a88-abb9-c2fb1f605cb5" />
</p>

## Factory reset your sculptor

```bash
mv ~/.sculptor ~/.sculptor.bkp."$(date +%s)"
```

## Clean up docker disk space

Sculptor auto-cleans up its images and containers on a cadence while it's running, so this shouldn't be necessary most of the time. However if you need to, here's a command to remove ALL docker containers and images (sculptor or not).

```bash
docker system prune -af
```

## Changing the system prompt

Agents follow explicit directions extremely well, so the system prompt is the perfect place to include general context like project details, relevant subdirectories, or specific coding guidelines. You can customize your system prompts at any time, either for all messages or on a per-message basis.

- **Example system prompts**

    ```markdown
    # Planning system prompt

    Don't write any code until I've approved the implementation or design strategy. For each request, propose 2-3 alternative strategies, architectures, or designs, clearly outlining tradeoffs for each. Recommend the best approach and actively ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities. I'd prefer extra discussion over incorrect assumptions.

    # Code implementation system prompt

    Implement the task exactly as described. If you encounter any ambiguity (unknown unknowns), pause immediately to request clarification. I'd rather clarify upfront than proceed based on incorrect assumptions. Write self-documenting code, adding comments only when necessary to explain the "why" behind specific implementation choices.

    # Debugging system prompt

    Thoroughly review all relevant code, deeply analyze potential causes, and formulate 2-3 hypotheses explaining the bug. For each hypothesis, identify specific locations for adding detailed logging to empirically validate them. Insert extensive logs accordingly. After adding logs, prompt me clearly about what tests or actions I should perform. I'll run these tests and share the logs with you. Use these results to draw conclusions and report back with your findings.
    ```

Updating the system prompt from the main task list page:
```
missing image
```

Updating the system prompt from an individual task page:
```
missing image
```

## Steering with inline TODOs

Inline TODOs or FIXMEs are one of the most reliable ways to steer the agent when iterating on real code. Because LLMs attend better to instructions **near the relevant code**, inline notes are often more effective than chat prompts alone.

To use inline TODOs:

- Local sync to the task you want to update
- Add TODOs or comments near the code you want the agent to modify
- Tell the agent where to look (e.g. ‚ÄúCheck foo.py for TODOs‚Äù)
